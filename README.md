# 📊 Mobile Sales Analysis Dashboard - Power BI

This is my **first Power BI project**, created during my learning phase.  
It presents a **Mobile Sales Analysis Dashboard** which gives insights on:

- 📈 Total Sales
- 🌍 Sales by Region
- 🛒 Top 5 Mobile Models
- 📅 Monthly Sales Trends
- 🏷️ Category-wise Performance

The data was cleaned and transformed using Power BI tools like:
- Power Query Editor
- DAX (basic measures)
- Slicers and interactive visuals

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Imported raw sales Excel data
- Built a structured data model
- Applied DAX formulas for better insights
- Used visual storytelling to represent trends

## 🙏 Special Thanks
Thanks to **Satish** for his Power BI Masterclass which helped me understand each part clearly.
